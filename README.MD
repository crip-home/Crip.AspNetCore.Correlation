# CRIP AspNetCore Correlation

The correlation ID is meant to be used to help Admin trace what was happening at the time of an error/request. It
is only valuable as an interactive tool to help the Admin track down your error. An Admin uses the correlation ID as
"breadcrumbs" to retrace a requests or processes in the Logging System to find what leads up to
and causes a problem.
